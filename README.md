Starting My Dev Journey

My background:
I’ve been working in the gaming industry for 7 years, including 1 year in game development as an Associate Producer.
After gaining professional experience, I began working on solo game development projects in my free time. In 2026, I committed fully to building my passion project, Raidbound.

Why I’m building:
I love the process of creating something from the ground up and watching the systems grow into a complete experience.
For me, development is about constant improvement. I find a lot of fulfilment turning ideas into something playable and meaningful.

What is raidbound:
Raidbound is a what I call a Raid Command Roguelite, focused on strategic party management and tactical combat. It blends multiple genres featuring: A threat-based ATB combat system, deep itemization and build variety, complex procedural-style map progression, and synergistic party and ability design. Through continuous testing and iteration, the project currently includes: 18,000+ lines of code, 14 playable hero types, 50+ abilities, 55 unique items. 21 unique enemies, 4 enemy factions, and 2 mechanic-focused boss encounters.

My goal: My primary goal is to polish Raidbound into a fun, replayable experience that I’m proud of. Once the first two acts are fully realized and engaging, I’ll consider that a major personal milestone. Long-term, I aim to release Raidbound on Steam so others can experience and enjoy the game.

What I’m working on now in no particular order: UI and UX polish across Acts 1 and 2, improving readability and GUI design, fixing bugs introduced during iteration, refining core systems based on playtesting. Each update brings the project closer to a complete, professional-quality experience.
