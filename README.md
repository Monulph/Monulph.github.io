Starting My Public Dev Journey

My background:
I've been working in gaming for 7 years with 1 year of game development behind me as an Associate Producer. 
I started doing solo game dev work off and on and in 2026 I started working on Raidbound.

Why I'm building:
I really enjoy working on a project and watching the pieces come together. 
Raidbound has been that able to itch that outlet and the project seems to be coming together. 

What is Raidbound:
Raidbound is a Raid Command Roguelite. It pulls from many genre's including threat-based (Everquest) atb combat system (Chrono Trigger) with deep itemization (Binding of Isaac) and comlex mapping (Slay the Spire) all in one experience.
Though it gets complex sometimes I've managed to get 18,000 lines of code, 14 hero types, 50+ abilities, 55 items, 20+ unique enemies, and 2 mechanic testing boss fights written into the game.

My goal:
Right now I am trying to polish Raidbound into a fun experience for myself. Once I have the first 2 acts into an engaging experience with long replayability I will be satisfied.
There are a few ideas written down or could also focus on act 3 and beyond.
Raidbound may end up on steam and if it does well I can continue to work on it.

What you’re working on now:
Focusing on UI polish for the first 2 acts and addressing the bugs that come up with changes.
