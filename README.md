Starting My Public Dev Journey — From Central to Solo Dev

My background:
I've been working in gaming for 7 years with 1 year of game development behind me as an Associate Producer. 
I started doing solo game dev work off and on and in 2026 I started working on Raidbound.

Why I'm building:
I really enjoy working on a project and watching the pieces come together. 
Raidbound has been that outlet and seems to be coming together however complex I am making it.

What Raidbound is:
Raidbound is a threat-based (Everquest) atb combat system (Chrono Trigger) with the deep itemization (Binding of Isaac) and comlex mapping (Slay the Spire) all in one experience.

My goal:
My goal right now is to polish Raidbound into a fun experience for myself. Once I have the first 2 acts into an engaging experience with long replayability I will be satisfied.
There are a few ideas written down or could also focus on act 3 and beyond.
Raidbound may end up on steam and if it does well I can continue to work on it.

What you’re working on now:
Right now I am working on UI polish for the first 2 acts and addressing the bugs that come up with changes.
