Starting My Public Dev Journey

My background:
I've been working in gaming for 7 years with 1 year of game development behind me as an Associate Producer. 
I started doing solo game dev work off and on and in 2026 I started working on Raidbound.

Why I'm building:
I really enjoy working on a project and watching the pieces come together. 

What is Raidbound:
Raidbound is what I am calling a Raid Command Roguelite. It pulls from many genre's including a threat-based (Everquest) atb combat system (Chrono Trigger) with deep itemization (Binding of Isaac) and complex mapping (Slay the Spire) all in one experience.
Through testing, I've developed 18,000 lines of code, 14 hero types, 50+ abilities, 55 items, 20+ unique enemies, and 2 mechanic testing boss fights.

My goal:
I am trying to polish Raidbound into a fun experience for myself. Once I have completed the first 2 acts into an engaging experience with long replayability I will be satisfied.
I would like for one day to have Raidbound up on steam for others to experience.

What you’re working on now:
My time is being spent focusing on UI polish for the first 2 acts and addressing the bugs that come up with changes.
